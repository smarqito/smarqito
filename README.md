### Hi! I'm Marco Ant√≥nio Sousa ‚ú®

I'm a 2nd yr student of Software Engeneering at University of Minho (@UMinho).

Currently working in a few projects, web and mobile app. 

- The web app has the back-end developed in .NET 5 (w/ IronPdf, Automapper, EF, Identity and so on) and the front-end in React Typescript. Some of the features are user and customer management; multi-address and multi-store by customer; debit and creation reports...
- The mobile app has been developed in Java and I'm fixing bugs and building some new features
- Developing a .NET with razor pages to work as a helper to a main desktop app. Currently being in use at a barcode scanner to show products info. A lot of feature to develop in the future.

Strong knowledge of the market and happy as a freelancer.
